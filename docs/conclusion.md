# Conclusion

Congratulations! You did it! You were able to convert a ML experiment with a
traditional approach to a well-defined, well-documented workflow that can scale
and serve a model to the outside world!

Let's take the time to make a summary of what you have done.

## Summary of what you have done

- [x] The model can be reproduced

Thanks to DVC, the steps to create the model are documented and can be executed
in order to reproduce the model.

- [x]  The changes done to a model can be tracked

Thanks to DVC, the changes done to a model can be tracked.

- [x] The model can be used outside of the experiment context

Thanks to BentoML, the model can be served and be used outside of the experiment
context.

## Going further

This workshop has been developed for the AI Days@HES-SO 2025 Conference. It is a
highly condensed version of our main MLOps course, which is available at
[mlops.swiss-ai-center.ch](https://mlops.swiss-ai-center.ch/).

The main course goes much further and offers a more complete understanding of
the subject, providing valuable knowledge and hands-on experience. We invite you
to explore it for a deeper dive into MLOps.

Happy learning! :)
