# Introduction

Learn how to serve and deploy the model using
[:simple-bentoml: BentoML](../tools.md) and
[:simple-docker: Docker](../tools.md).

## Environment

This guide has been written with :simple-apple: macOS and :simple-linux: Linux
operating systems in mind. If you use :fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows, you
might encounter issues. Please use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](../wsl2.md)
(WSL 2) for optimal results.

For this part, you also need to have
[:simple-docker: Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed. Docker will be
utilized for setting up and managing the container registry.
